<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository:</li>
    <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortening-service.git</code>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
    <code>cd url-shortening-service</code>
    <li>Install dependencies:</li>
    <code>npm install</code>
    <li>Build the project:</li>
    <code>npm run build</code>
    <li>Start the server:</li>
    <code>npm run start:prod</code>
</ol>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Once the service is running, you can use it to shorten URLs by sending POST requests to the /shorten endpoint with a JSON payload containing the long URL. Detailed documentation of the API endpoints and usage instructions can be found in the API documentation.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Shorten long URLs to unique, shortened URLs.</li>
    <li>Track analytics including clicks, referral sources, active hours, and device types.</li>
    <li>Secure user authentication and authorization.</li>
    <li>Efficient data management with database storage and caching.</li>
    <li>Scalable architecture to handle high volumes of requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>
<p>The analytics feature of this service provides detailed insights into URL usage. It tracks the number of clicks on each shortened URL, as well as additional information such as referral sources, active hours, and device types used to access the URLs. These analytics are accessible via an API, allowing users to query and analyze the data for their URLs.</p>

<h2 id="scalability-solutions">Scalability Solutions</h2>
<p>To ensure scalability and performance, several measures have been implemented:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Efficient Backend:</strong> The backend is built using Nest.js and TypeScript, providing a robust and efficient foundation for handling high volumes of requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Optimization:</strong> URL shortening algorithms are optimized for efficient storage and retrieval, ensuring minimal latency even under heavy load.</li>
    <li><strong>Caching with Redis:</strong> Redis is used for caching to enhance the performance of URL retrieval, reducing database load and response times.</li>
    <li><strong>Horizontal Scaling:</strong> The service is designed to scale horizontally by deploying multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer, distributing traffic evenly and increasing capacity as needed.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The service includes extensive testing, including unit tests and integration tests, to ensure reliability and performance. Testing is automated using frameworks such as Jest, and tests can be run using the <code>npm test</code> command.</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>The service can be deployed to various hosting providers or cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Heroku. Deployment instructions may vary depending on the chosen platform but typically involve configuring environment variables, setting up databases, and deploying the built application.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints, data models, and architecture can be found in the <code>docs</code> directory of the project. This documentation provides detailed information on how to use the service, including example requests and responses.</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-and-maintenance">Monitoring and Maintenance</h2>
<p>The service includes monitoring and logging features to track performance metrics, errors, and usage patterns. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can be integrated to monitor server metrics and application health. Regular maintenance tasks include monitoring performance, applying updates, and optimizing database queries for improved efficiency.</p>
